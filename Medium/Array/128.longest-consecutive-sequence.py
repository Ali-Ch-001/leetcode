128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Difficulty: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the
longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3,
4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

 

Constraints:

	• 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5

	• -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        values = set(nums)
        best = 0
        for value in values:
            if value - 1 in values:
                continue
            length = 1
            while value + length in values:
                length += 1
            best = max(best, length)
        return best
