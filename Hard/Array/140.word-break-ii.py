140. Word Break II
Difficulty: Hard
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in
s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word.
Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple
times in the segmentation.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict =
["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen
apple"]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: []

 

Constraints:

	• 1 <= s.length <= 20

	• 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000

	• 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10

	• s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.

	• All the strings of wordDict are unique.

• Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't
exceed 10^5.
